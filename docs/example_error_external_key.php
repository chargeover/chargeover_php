/**
 * Example of running into a duplicate external key error
 * 
 * External keys are used in ChargeOver to provide an easy way to integrate 
 * external systems with ChargeOver. You can stuff your own keys into any 
 * ChargeOver object, and then later query by and reference that object by 
 * your own external key value.
 * 
 * External keys are a UNIQUE CONSTRAINT in ChargeOver - e.g. you can't have 
 * two customers with the same external key. Trying to do that will result 
 * in an error message. 
 * 
 * See the docs for more details:
 * 	http://chargeover.com/docs/rest-api.html#external-keys
